## About Me 
I have always been passionate about the world of tech and creating new projects, that is the reason why on 2021 I decided to learn about coding on my own while working as an Au Pair in Washington DC, allowing me to develop my enthusiasm for working with people from different places and sharing my culture while training as a JavaScript Developer. 

When I returned to Mexico, I looked for an opportunity to continue developing as a Front End Developer, that was when I was admitted to Laboratoria, a Latin American organization where I spent 6 months developing projects along international teams through Web Development technologies and agile methodologies.

## Skills 
- Languages: JavaScript (ES6), CSS3, HTML5
- Technologies: React, Firebase, Node.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Git, Github, NPM, Visual Studio Code
- Tools: Figma, Canva, SketchUp, AutoCAD
- Agile Methodologies: SCRUM

##  Currently Working On:
A CRUD and SPA application developed with React, through which a restaurant can take orders using a tablet and send them to the kitchen to be prepared orderly and efficiently, solving the same problem: how to keep the interface and status synchronized. (React, JavaScript, CSS, Unit Testing) ðŸ‘¾
