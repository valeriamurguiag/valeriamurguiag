## About Me 
I'm a Mexican Web Developer focused on Front-End Development. I've always been passionate about the world of tech and creating new projects, that is the reason why on 2021 I decided to learn coding on my own while working as an Au Pair in Washington DC, allowing me to develop my enthusiasm for working with people from different places and sharing my culture. When I returned to Mexico, I looked for an opportunity to continue developing as a Front-End Developer, and that was when I was admitted to Laboratoria, an organization that encourages Latin American women to start their careers in the world of tech.
